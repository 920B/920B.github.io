                            The VSC extension is advertised as open source software. But itâ€™s not

                The extension isn't exactly proprietary though. If you download the extension as a <code>.vsix</code> file from the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VEXRobotics.vexcode" target="_blank">VSCode Marketplace</a>, and then extract it, you will have <a href="./VEXRobotics.vexcode-0.4.2.zip" target="_blank" download>The Complete Source Code</a>. You can also view it from the VSCode Extensions directory if you have it installed.

                The source also includes the <code>vexcom</code> utility, which is the underlying software that communicates with the brain (you can also find it in most versions of PROS). This opens a few doors because <code>vexcom</code> doesn't impose the same restrictions that VEXcode and the extension do (e.g. you can set the team number on the V5 brain to a long string of characters).

                I am only mentioning this because a few people, specifically those who want a PyCharm plugin, might find this information useful.

                Hopefully VEX will maintain the extension on their <a href="https://github.com/VEX-Robotics/vex-vsc-extension" target="_blank">GitHub</a> in the future. That will make it a lot easier for the community to make suggestions and find/fix bugs.
